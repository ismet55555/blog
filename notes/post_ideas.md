## Commiting to something and adapting it as personailty/label/identity is a super power ... until it is not

Two scenerios that result in different results:

1. You go to the gym to do what people do at the gym

2. You are THE gym guy who identifies himself as one

Some may think about the bad side of the coin is adapting a personality
like being a flat-earher or worst case all-in on like being a cyber criminal.
It has to be *mostly* constructive to you, and *mostly* not destructive
to the community or the environment.
