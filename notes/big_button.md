# BIG BUTTON OUTLINE

## Overview

- Device Purpose: When button is pressed, a SMS message with a joke is
  send to my phone
- Project Purpose:
  - Develop a better understanding of embedded development in Rust
  - Develop a whole and presentable embedded device
  - Develop a complete embedded Rust project

## TODO

- GitHub Repo branch for tutorial

  - Each branch and code goes with a part
  - Add to post 6 and forware
  - Nice button "View Code So Far"
  - GitHub logo or code symbol
  - Button looks like a nice terminal

## Publication Strategy

- Online course (ie. Udemy)

  - Requires videos

- LinkedIn post series

  - One post per every few days

- Hybrid

  - Five initial posts to linked in and guide to course
  - Have a few little intro posts (appetizers)

## Random Notes

TODO:

- Linear diagrams of skills chart
- Quiz with point systems - need formula
  - Textbox - nope!
  - Sliders - Number of years
  - Checkboxes - "At least X years" - Easiest! - THIS!
    - `<CheckItem txt="Something" />`
  - Radio button - "never used" "somewhat familiar" "very familiar"

TODO

- What is the skillset and knowledge range (range image)

  - Is this for me?
  - From never coded to 5 years of Rust Programming
  - From never build anything to maker god
  - Note that interest and passion can trump experience here?

- Specific Skillset
  - Terminal - Know what it is. Have used it.
  - IDE - Know what it is. Have used it.
  - Programming - Know what it is. Have done it.

Bar chart with all of these??
Radial chart?

A Quiz for each section!

- Spits out likelihood this tutorial is for you
- Each option brings about some number of points
