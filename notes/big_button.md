# BIG BUTTON OUTLINE

## Overview

- Device Purpose: When button is pressed, a SMS message with a joke is
  send to my phone
- Project Purpose:
  - Develop a better understanding of embedded development in Rust
  - Develop a whole and presentable embedded device
  - Develop a complete embedded Rust project

## TODO

- Think about framing this project

- GitHub Repo branch for tutorial
  - Each branch and code goes with a part
  - Add to post 6 and 7

- A very initial overview and introduction post
  - What is the skillset and knowledge range (range image)
    - Is this for me?
    - From never coded to 5 years of Rust Programming
    - From never build anything to maker god
    - Note that interest and passion can trump experience here?
  - Specific Skillset
    - Terminal, IDE
    - Programmed before
  - What are we making
  - How to use this tutorial series
  - Is there a way to only deal with the microcontroller (minimum)

- Tools and Components
  - Restructure for only what is needed for rust development part
    - Controller, debug probe, breakout board, buzzer, small wires or button

- IDE setup?
  - VS Code - Plugins
  - NeoVim - Plugins

## Publication Strategy

- Online course (ie. Udemy)

  - Requires videos

- LinkedIn post series

  - One post per every few days

- Hybrid
  
  - Five initial posts to linked in and guide to course
  - Have a few little intro posts (appetizers)
