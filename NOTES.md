## TODO

### Critical

- Combine to tutorial series
  - Navigation steps on the side?

### Nice to Have

- Emoji plugin
- Post comments and reactions
- Blog subscription
  - RSS Feed
  - Email service
- Mermaid graphs
- Adjust spacing on TOC
- Figure out how to present References (smaller font?)
- ASCII Heading
- Remove underline from ToC links
- A very small section on every post, claiming what AI was used for
- Sticky headings?
