## TODO

Now that we have a ton of things ordered or are actively looking for tools and components,
let's focus on our software setup. The aim of this post is to install, setup, and test 
all needed software components for our project. This will not include any of our
programming code.

- Hardware layout and connection for testing
- Basic software requirements
- Software tool installation
- Test run
