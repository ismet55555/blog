## Introduction

In this post we will go over the general tools, hardware, and components needed
for this project. I will try my best to cover all the critical parts, however
note that as with any personal engineering project of this kind:

- You might get away with not having some of the tools or different/better tools
- You can do things a different way or your own way

Remember, this list is targeted for the casual hobbiest and maker. While I try my
best to share everything you will need, this list may not be 100% comprehensive.

**And as always, there are usually many and various ways to solve the same problem.**

<Aside variant="note">
  If you are the maker type of person who already has most or all of this stuff
  in your personal workshop, feel free to glance over this post. This post 
  attempts to get as many people with the largest skill level range onto
  the same page for this project.
</Aside>

<Aside variant="tip">
  If you are unfamiliar with any of these tools or components, a quick google search or a 
  AI chat prompt on any of these soldering tools will get you going on how to fundementally
  use them.

## Tools

### 3D Printer

Many embedded/IoT/wearable prototypes start with a an idea or rough sketch
that is then turned into three dimensional objects with using 3D printing.
The flexibility, customization, and quick iteration of a 3D printer make it
ivaluable.

Here I am using the most popular hobbiest 3D printer ever made:
[Enter 3 by Creality](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer).

   alt="cool relevant image"
   class="w-1/2 mx-auto border border-2 border-accentColor"
 />
</a>

While there are better [PLA-based](https://www.hatchbox3d.com/collections/pla-1-75mm)
3D printers out there ([some list here](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-3d-printers)) with amazing abilities and support, the Ender 3 offers a great value
and has a ton of available online resources such as a huge [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/),
videos, manuals, tips, tricks, [upgrades](https://store.creality.com/blog/ender-3-upgrades), and more.

Note that a self-assembled 3D printer will always need calibration, [bed leveling](https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-bed-leveling-all-you-need-to-know/),
and [testing](https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-test-print-the-best-models-to-challenge-your-ender-3/)
before actually printing something good.

You will obviously need [PLA fillement](https://www.hatchbox3d.com/collections/pla-1-75mm) of
some color. The color of the fillament will not matter for this project since we are going to
sand and paint our 3D prints.

### Soldering Station

This project will require some soldering of various components such as wires and termials.
There are a lot of various soldering tools with a variety of quality and use-case.

{/*
Picking one can be overwhelming and can depend on many factors. For instance, if you are a hobbiest
tinkerer/maker who only solders once in a while, you certainly do not need the top brand
soldering tools.
*/}

The soldering station that I am working with and that I recommend for beginners is a
all-in-one soldering station kit shown below and [available on Amazon here](https://a.co/d/g1hfNg9).

Here we have everything from [helping hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh5FcqtlWWA)
to solder to [solder sucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGSeSk8QWsE) for desoldering and cleanup.

### Wire Tools

Building anything electrical will require work with wires. Specifically, for our low current 
and low voltage applications we will be using small [wire gauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge#Tables_of_AWG_wire_sizes). .

Wire cutters are often the same tool as wire cutters. Again, as a casual hobbiest, I would
not recommend the top tools, here a [regular wire cutter/stripper](https://a.co/d/fjoGu2d) is just fine.

### Multimeter

Often times we will need to test if two things are soldered correctly, connected right, or
give us some voltage at some time. In these types of situations and many more,
a [multimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter) comes in handy. 

A multimeter measures multiple electrical properties: voltage, resistance, and current.
It is one of the most basic and most useful electical tools you can get familiar with.

Luckily, for the vast majority of hobbiest use-cases, a regular grade multimeter is
not very expensive and highly available.

I recommend selecting a multimeter that includes conveninet one with a good set of probe
features and clamps, a good display, and a kick stand. Maybe something like
[this one](https://a.co/d/6yqiaka).

Often times to protect a sensitive places like solder points between a wire and a terminal,
or a wire and another wire we heat shrink rubber tubing.
