## Introduction

In this post we will go over the general tools, hardware, and components needed
for this project. I will try my best to cover all the critical parts, however
note that as with any personal engineering project of this kind:

- You might get away with not having some of the tools or different/better tools
- You can do things a different way or your own way

**As always, there usually many and various ways to solve the same problem.**
