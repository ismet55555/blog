Let me ask you - What is it like to vacation in Japan? Or how exactly do
you become a medical doctor. To what actual detail can
you tell me? If you have never done the thing or been the thing, how would you really know?
And how would you know within the concept of your own world view and abilities?

Let's outline the extremes here: On one side you absolutely don't even
know the thing/concept/place even exsists, it's invisible on any level
(ie. That one exam at that specific time that opens doors).
On the other side you aboslutely know everything there is to know about
the thing/concept/place (ie. How to file that claim at your company where
you worked 20 years at).

In reality, this spectrum is more open ended on the later side. That is, you defeintly
can not know a thing and never knew it existed (ie. That special hook
mountain climbers use). However, the level of detail and insight you can get
from something already familiar is infinite (ie. Reading a book a second time).

In common conversations the falesy that always comes up is the 

So these thoughts and cocepts are definetly not new. [BACKGROUND HERE]


Moving and living in another country often reveals how something that
is common knowledge and obvious paths can be comletely invisible.
For example, moving to the US,

Jokes, education path, dating/friendship norms, gender roles, behavior rules,
dealing with authority, and so on



My thoughts are that there are roughly four levels of really
knowing something


Levels of really knowing and experience

1. You know about it. Have the info. Can google it. Don't know anyone
   personally that actually does the thing.

2. You know someone that is not close to you, that does the thing, or is the thing.

3. The community around you does the thing or is the thing. Are encouraged to try
   it or be it.

4. You have someone very close to you that does the thing or is the thing.
   Like father is an engineer, brother is an engineer, you pretty much can guess
   what its like to become and be and engineer. The family goes skiing in
   aspen.

5. You yourself have done the thing or are the thing.

NOTE: Some things like suffering and pain can't be communicated but the
reaction to them can. "If that guy can suffer through it, why can't I?"
