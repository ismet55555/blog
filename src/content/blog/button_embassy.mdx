## Introduction

<Tag color="green" txt="üíª HACKER" /> Here we will go over the concept
of programming abstraction, levels of programming, programming frameworks,
and the framework we will use for our embedded programming adventures.
This again will be more of a explanatory-type of step before we jump
into more code.

## Levels of Programming

You can manually program embedded devices
at just about any level you want to. From a [high-level](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)
where you do not need any knowledge about the underlying computer hardware, to a [low-level](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language).
where any written code needs the consideration of its target hardware.

Remember, that no advantage is free and must come at a cost (no free lunch ü•™).

<Figure

  url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch"
/>

If, for example, you want to use a high-level function that quickly and conveninetly does
50 things behind the scenes, you are effectively trusting the "invisible" code to do
what/how/when you need. You also are accepting less control of the underlying
system (there might be other functions you would not know about).

However, low-level programming is not nessearitly the correct/full answer all the time. 
The lower level you go, the more complex, time consuming, and error-prone programming
will get.

Most times, there is a trade-off between high-level convenience, ease, and programming speed
and low-level control, customization, and code execution speed.

You *CAN* program a microcontroler in raw [Assembly Programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language),
but it would take a ton of knowledge and effort to exacly get it to do what you want it to do.

This is where frameworks come into play and shine!


## Frameworks

Generally speaking, a programming framework could just about be anything that
makes programming easier, more conveninet, and accessible. A set of custom functions
could theoratically be considered a simple framework.

  caption="Just a general version of a framework"
  url="TODO"

Here in our case, we are talking about a embedded hardware programming framework
that enables us to program a microcontroller chip efficiently. That is, giving you
a lot of pre-written code and ways for a more plug-and-play experience.


<Aside variant="note">
  You might be wondering: What is a difference between a framework and a
  library/package? Generally speaking, a framework itself calls your code
  and also may call library/package code. However, typically library/package
  code does not call your code or the framework. (ie. who calls who)

## Embassy üè¢

Enter [Embassy](https://embassy.dev/)! Embassy is a Rust-based asynchronous embedded
programming framework.

The obvious selling point about Ebassy is that it is based in Rust programming launguage.
However, there are other great features Embassy offeres (check out their [website](https://embassy.dev/)).
Let's discuss some of the more relevant advantages. 

### Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous (non-blocking) programming is a programming paradigm that allows operations to execute
independently of the main program flow. In the context of embedded systems, this means
a microcontroller can start an operation (like reading from a sensor) and then
continue with other work while waiting for that operation to complete.

<Figure

The comprehensive explanation of async programing and the contrast to prallel or concurrent
programming is outside of the scope of this tutorial. However, I encourage you to review
some great explanations on asyncrhnoous programming: [Article 1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/asynchronous-programming),
[Article 2](https://blog.veeso.dev/blog/en/async-rust-for-dummies/),
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1afhgomys),
[Short](https://youtu.be/v6sI1tidSw8?si=INO0Z4458LJvQ5EJ).

Here Embassy's asynchronous approach offers:

- **Power efficiency**: Tasks yield CPU when waiting, saving power in battery-operated devices
- **No polling**: Wait for events without constantly checking status flags
- **Task prioritization**: Assign importance levels to different operations
- **Thread safety**: Compile-time guarantees prevent data races between concurrent operations
- **Simplified concurrency**: Asynchronous code reads sequentially despite concurrent execution

### Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)

A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is a type of [operating system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)
designed to process data and events with minimal delay and precise timing guarantees.

The term "real-time" refers to the fact that the system must very quickly react to events
(button presses, network requests, etc) within a small time-constraint.
It's like a chef in a busy restaurant who must respond immediately when the bell rings
for a new order - there's no time to wait or the customers will be unhappy.

If you are interested in anything RTOS checkout the [ROTS wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system),
or this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5EtpSDOHk).

The Embassy framework is a RTOS that include the following advantages:

- **Cooperative multitasking**: Tasks run until they explicitly give up control
- **Lightweight executor**: Minimal overhead compared to traditional RTOS solutions
- **Deterministic timing**: Predictable execution patterns for time-sensitive applications
- **No dynamic allocation**: Static task allocation eliminates heap fragmentation
- **Interrupt integration**: Seamless handling of hardware interrupts within the async model

<Aside variant="note">
  Remember, Embassy is not the only or the most popular RTOS framework out there.
  Others include [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/), [pyRTOS](https://github.com/Rybec/pyRTOS),
  and [many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_real-time_operating_systems)
</Aside>


### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

The [Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_abstraction#In_operating_systems)
is exactly as it sounds: A layer that abstracts the underlying hardware code making the
hardware functions more accessible.

The HAL allows the same code to be used accross different hardware devices. For example,
setting an LED to high/on, would look very similar on a Raspberry Pi Pico or a 
STM32 microcontroller. This allows programmers to easier update hardware-related code.
HAL often allow programmers to write device-independent.

<Figure
  src={tba}
  caption="Diagram of layers of programming code abstraction"
  url="TODO"
/>

The Embassy project maintains these HALs for select hardware, but you can still
use HALs from other projects with Embassy. That is, if you want more control for 
the underlying layer you can use the specific HALs (ie. [embassy-rp](TODO), [embassy-stm32](TODO))

As a simplified example, here is a program setting an LED to high/on for a Raspberry Pi Pico:

```rust title="embassy-rp"
todo toto.sh
```

And here is the same code but coded for a STM32 microcontroller:

```rust title="embassy-stm32"
todo toto.sh
```

Some advantages of Embassy's HAL system include:

- **Cross-platform abstractions**: Single API works across different microcontroller families
- **Peripheral drivers**: Ready-made implementations for UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, and more
- **Type-state API**: Impossible to misuse peripherals due to compile-time checks
- **Target-specific modules**: Specialized support for:
  - STM32 microcontrollers via `embassy-stm32`
  - Raspberry Pi microcontrollers via `embassy-rp`
  - Nordic nRF chips via `embassy-nrf`
  - ESP32 chips via `embassy-esp`
