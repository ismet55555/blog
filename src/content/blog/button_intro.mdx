## The Embedded Fantasy

**Imagine the following scenario:** You get a call from a good and respected
friend. After some informal conversation he/she switches their tone and prepares to
carefully ask you for an opinion on an idea he/she has. At this point you already
know what is going to happen next.

/>

As a IT professional, you have experienced
this many times. A friend or relative corners you at some event and
*"confidentially"* shares his/her genius industry disruptive idea with a glimmer in their eyes.
So you go into autopilot-politely-interested mode, carefully scanning the conversation
for an exit. But something is different. The more you listen, the more your
friend's story and idea catches your attention.

You become more engaged and inspired.
You can tell they have done their homework. There are some basic questions that
need to be answered, but in all, this is not just something they woke up with
today. To you this seems to be the real deal.

To be more specific, your friend's idea is a prototype of a physical device,
maybe even a Internet of Things (IoT) device or some wearable. You are galvanized, energized,
and want to help, however, it is obvious that you don't have any embedded
systems knowledge and would not know where to start .... that is, until you
find this random online blog series!

Alright, maybe this intro story to [embedded system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system)
is a little too dramatic and too specific, but I do hope I got your attention to read further!

## Project Backstory

Let me explain how this entire blog/tutorial series came about.
Where I live, trash pick up is Tuesdays and Fridays. Or is it Mondays and
Thursdays? Well, maybe one of those days is Wednesday...?

<Figure

/>

I still question myself and still can
miss trash day.

Now, I could do two very easy things to solve this issue.

1. Stop being an idiot, just memorize the days, and move on.
2. Set a recurring alarm on my phone for the right days.

Because I am always looking
for a insightful and rewarding engineering side project to be inspired by.
I opted to come up with a much more complicated approach.

I wanted a project to learn and
apply an embedded systems project. Furthermore, I wanted to be more
comfortable with Rust ("blazingly fast") programming as well.

My goal was to create a button that when pressed, sends a
text message to my phone and monitors text message responses.
This allows me to snooze or silence the reminder to take out the trash.

I know, not very big or thought out, but I guess reason enough to
get going and create some thing!

So in short, and very basically,
we are building and programming a
<span class="text-red-500 font-bold">BIG glorified push BUTTON alarm clock</span>.


## Project Goal

Now, obviously you do not need to use this device for trash day reminders
or anything close to that. However, going through this blog series
**should enable you to reuse methods, code, or improvise to develop your own ideas.**

It is my hope that after working through this
project you yourself will be able to solve some problem that requires
embedded systems and Rust programming.

<Aside variant="note">
  *Embedded* can mean many things. Simply put, think of it as programming
  a stand-alone chip/microcontroller that does not already have a
  running operating system (ie. Linux).

The project that we will be developing will be a large red button assembly. This
button assembly will have a variety of features:

- Super large red glowing button
- Fully battery operated (rechargeable, battery lasting for at least a week)
- Multiple fancy LEDs with a variety of light patterns
- Sound buzzer for audio signal feedback
- System On/Off toggle switch
- Wireless internet interconnectivity via REST API

At the time of writing this project introduction, I am not fully able to summarize
the specifics of the entire project, I am still working through details. 
This tutorial is evolving as you are reading this

## Semi-Prerequisite Resources

Over the course of this project outline. I will try my very best to describe
and point out all the tools and little weird gotchas I had to struggle with when
developing this project.

Before jumping into this project it would not be the worst idea to overview
the following items. 

- [Fusion 360 3D CAD Software](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription)
- [Ender 3 3D Printer](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer)
- [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/)
- [Rust Programming](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Basic Electrical Circuits](https://www.12voltplanet.co.uk/electrical-circuit-basics.html)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

With each blog post, there will be a **"Resources"** section for further
reading, learning, and review.
