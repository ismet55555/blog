## Table of Contents

## Introduction

In this post we will go over the general tools, hardware, and components needed
for this project. I will try my best to cover all the critical parts, however
note that as with any personal engineering project of this kind:

- You might get away with not having some of the tools or different/better tools
- You can do things a different way or your own way

Remember, this list is targeted for the casual hobbiest and maker. While I try 
to share everything you will need, this list may not be 100% comprehensive.

I completly understand the following seems like a lot, however this is a
detailed outline to reference back during other phases of the project if needed.

**And as always, there are usually many and various ways to solve the same problem.**


<Aside variant="note">
  If you are the maker type of person who already has most or all of this stuff
  in your personal workshop, feel free to glance over the majority of this post. This post 
  attempts to get as many people with the largest skill level range onto
  the same page for this project.
</Aside>

<Aside variant="tip">
  If you are unfamiliar with any of these tools or components, a quick google search or a 
  AI chat prompt on any of these tools and components will get you going on how to
  fundamentally use them.

## Tools

### 3D Printer

Many embedded/IoT/wearable prototypes start with a an idea or rough sketch
that is then turned into three dimensional objects with using 3D printing.
The flexibility, customization, and quick iteration of a 3D printer make it
invaluable.

Here I am using the most popular hobbiest 3D printer ever made:
[Enter 3 by Creality](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer).

<Figure
  src={ender3}
  url="https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer"
/>

While there are better [PLA-based](https://www.hatchbox3d.com/collections/pla-1-75mm)
3D printers out there ([some list here](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-3d-printers)) with amazing abilities and support, the Ender 3 offers a great value
and has a ton of available online resources such as a huge [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/),
videos, manuals, tips, tricks, [upgrades](https://store.creality.com/blog/ender-3-upgrades), and more.

Note that a self-assembled 3D printer will always need calibration, [bed leveling](https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-bed-leveling-all-you-need-to-know/),
and [testing](https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-test-print-the-best-models-to-challenge-your-ender-3/)
before actually printing something good.

You will obviously need [PLA filament](https://www.hatchbox3d.com/collections/pla-1-75mm) of
some color. The color of the filament will not matter for this project since we are going to
sand and paint our 3D prints.

### Soldering Station

This project will require some soldering of various components such as wires and terminals.
There are a lot of various soldering tools with a variety of quality and use-case.

{/*
Picking one can be overwhelming and can depend on many factors. For instance, if you are a hobbiest
tinkerer/maker who only solders once in a while, you certainly do not need the top brand
soldering tools.
*/}

The soldering station that I am working with and that I recommend for beginners is a
all-in-one soldering station kit shown below and [available on Amazon here](https://a.co/d/g1hfNg9).

<Figure
  src={solderStation}
  url="https://a.co/d/fjoGu2d"
/>

Here we have everything from [helping hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh5FcqtlWWA)
to solder to [solder sucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGSeSk8QWsE) for de-soldering and cleanup.

### Wire Tools

Building anything electrical will require work with wires. Specifically, for our low current 
and low voltage applications we will be using small [wire gauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge#Tables_of_AWG_wire_sizes).

Wire cutters are often the same tool as wire cutters. Again, as a casual hobbiest, I would
not necessarily recommend the top shelf tools, here a [regular wire cutter/stripper](https://a.co/d/fjoGu2d) is just fine.

<Figure
  src={wireCutter}
  url="https://a.co/d/2Z5Z7AV"
/>

### Multimeter

Often times we will need to test if two things are soldered correctly, connected right, or
give us some voltage at some point and time. In these types of situations (and more),
a [multimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter) comes in very handy. 

A multimeter measures multiple electrical properties: voltage, resistance, and current.
It is one of the most basic and most useful electrical tools you can get familiar with.
Here is a [quick overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF3OyQ3HwfU) on how
to use a multimeter.

Luckily, for the vast majority of hobbiest use-cases, a regular grade multimeter is
just fine, not very expensive, and highly available.

I recommend selecting a multimeter with a good set of probe
features and clamps, a good display, and a kick stand. Maybe something like
[this one](https://a.co/d/6yqiaka).

<Figure

### Other Tools

- **Small Screwdriver Set** - Working with smaller electronics or enclosures you are guaranteed
  to use smaller screw drivers. I prefer interchangeable tips one. ([Recommendation](https://a.co/d/iezxoev)).

- **Hand-held Electric Sander** - We will be sanding down 3D prints to make prints looks less like 
  a 3D print. While you can try to use sand paper, an electric sander will save you much time
  and hassle. My recommendation is to use an electric sander that you can use with regular sand paper 
  and not proprietary stick-on or odd shape sand paper. ([Recommendation](https://a.co/d/1kmXrED)).

- **Sand Paper** - For using width the electric sander and for finer manual hand sanding, make sure
  you have a the following [sandpaper grits/coarseness](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/sandpaper-grit-chart/): 

    - 120 Grit - Fine *(Getting rougher surface imperfections out)*
    - 220 Grit - Very-fine
    - 400 Grit - Super-fine
    - 800 Grit - Ultra-fine *(Polish the surface)*

## Components

### Raspberry Pi Pico W

The [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) (RPi Pico W) 
[microcontroller](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/01-background/index.html)
will be our central brain for this project. All logic will live on this microcontroller.

<Figure
  src={rpiPico}
  url="https://a.co/d/bqi2hE3"
/>

This Raspberry Pi is powered by an [arm-based](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Cortex-M0-Plus)
[RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/specifications/) chip ([RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/)
for RPi Pico 2), while having other on-board [peripherals](https://www.labcenter.com/blog/sim-microcontroller-peripherals/)
such as a wireless module *(the `W` in the name)*, a bluetooth chip, temperature sensor, and more.

See the official [Raspberry Pi Pico documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html)
for more information. 


<Aside variant="tip">
  You will have to connect a debug module (see next section) to the RPi. The debug module connects
  to the RPi Pico via 3 debug pins. I would recommend buying the
  [RPi pico with pins already pre-soldered](https://a.co/d/6ulNrik).
</Aside>

The Raspberry Pi Pico W is obviously not the only popular microcontroller of its kind.
You could select a different microcontroller that fits a specific need or skill set.
For example, the [Freenove ESP32-WROOM Board](https://store.freenove.com/products/fnk0090)
is also not a bad choice, however in scope of our project we will stick to the Raspberry Pi.


### Raspberry Pi Pico Debug Probe

When programming and developing on a microcontroller, it is crucial that you know what is
happening on the microcontroller when it is running. That is, when connecting your computer
to the microcontroller you are able to actively view code deployment logs, runtime logging
messages, error messages, and other connection-related messages.

Typically microcontollers provide a debug probe/module that accomplishes just that. Our debug
probe will connect via [UART serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter)
port via the [**3 pins** *(TX, GND, RX)*](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/debug/debug-connector-specification.pdf)
specially designated to it on the Raspberry Pi Pico and located next to the large wireless module.

<Figure
  src={debugProbe}
  url="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html"
/>

See the official [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html)
for more information.

<Aside variant="note">
  There is a way to achieve this same function but without a Raspberry Pi debug probe. This
  involves a *second* Raspberry Pi Pico connected to your main one. Here is [more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i2gLeBal9Y)
  about it. However, to gain simplicity by sacrificing cost we are sticking to the official
  debug probe provided for the Raspberry Pi.
</Aside>

### Raspberry Pi Pico Breakout Boards

For development and for actual final implementation of our Raspberry Pi Pico W, we will use breakout boards.
A [breakout board](https://soldered.com/learn/breakout-boards-what-are-they-and-why-you-should-use-them/) will take these pins and “break them out”
onto a separate circuit board. That is, it maps the inputs and outputs of our
Raspberry Pi Pico W onto easily accessible connectors.

We will use two breakout boards:

- **For Development and Testing** - During programming and troubleshooting we will utilize a more
  complete breakout board. This breakout board includes LEDs for pin inputs and outputs,
  more ground connectors, clear labels, and more. We will use this breakout board during
  initial programming, testing, and iterations. ([Online Link](https://a.co/d/6anFgCV))

<Figure
  src={breakoutBoardDev}
  url="https://a.co/d/6anFgCV"
/>

- **For Final Implementation Into Project** - When we are ready to integrate/mount the 
  Raspberry Pi Pico W into the our assembled project, we will use use a more minimal breakout
  board. ([Online Link](https://a.co/d/e6cDFwv))

<Figure

  url="https://a.co/d/e6cDFwv"
/>

### DC-DC Boost Converter (Battery Charging Module)

Our goal is to build a device that is powered by an onboard battery pack. When this
battery runs out of power, we want to be able to seamlessly recharge the battery
without disconnecting power to the running system.
This is were our [boost converter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_converter) comes into play.

In essence, the boost converter is connected to the battery source *(3.7V)*, to a USB A plug source *(5V)*,
and to the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller input *(5V)*.

{/*
TODO: Diagram here with boost converter
*/}

We will be using the [PowerBoost 500 from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5035)
that can run from 1.8V DC batteries or higher. It converts this to a 5.2V DC voltage for our 
microcontroller.

### Electrical Components

The following are a series of electrical components needed for this project.

- **Big Cool Push Button** - This will be our amazing front and center push button for this
  project. It includes a nice panel mount and a included LED which lights up the push button. 
  [Online Link](https://a.co/d/gUhGwOv)
- **Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) (8mm)** - We will have a set of controlled LEDs all around
  our device. LEDs will be able to light up specific patterns. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/6LiMbeh)
- **Toggle Switch** - This will be our main power switch of the device, turning it on and off. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/0lwa7hN)
- **Micro USB B to USB A Plug** - With this component we will be able to charge our device. [Online Link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4213)
- **Buzzer** - The big button device will be able to send audio feedback via a small buzzer that
  will be mounted inside of the enclosure. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/8HOhxGi)
- **Battery Pack** - Our device will be battery operated with a long barry life. This big
  battery will ensure that our button device will operate for a long time. [Online Link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5035)
- **Wire Assortment** - Any electrical project of this type will need wire. In our case, this
  assortment provides us with a small gauge wire in different colors. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/jcNjgDM)

{/*
TODO: Make accent color and bold
*/}

### Other Components

- **LED Holder Bezel Mount** - To cleanly and firmly place LEDs onto the exterior of the device
  enclosure, we will be using LED holders that snap into a pre-fabricated hole. This way
  the LEDs are easily removable if needed, while also looking very nice from the outside. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/9wcF20p)
- **Threaded Inserts** - There are a variety of ways of joining 3D printed part components. 
  You can snap them together, glue them, weld them, etc. However, we are going to use threaded
  brass inserts. That is, these threaded inserts are heated into the 3D print so that we 
  can use regular screws to join the parts. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/efibCTj)
- **Screws** - Here we are primary concerted about screwing down 3D parts and components.
  The two sizes that we will be using are *#2-56x5/32 (x5)* and *#4-40x3/8 (x6)*. For these
  screws you are probably better off getting them as a small pack online or at a local
  hardware store.
- **3D Print Filler Putty** - 3D prints can sometimes leave relatively large imperfections that
  are hard to sand smoothly. In those cases, we can fill the imperfection or hole with
  putty material and in turn sand it down. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/2mu3jvd)
- **Spray Filler, Paint, and Clear Coat** - I understand that this may be a lot, however
  in order to make a 3D print look nice and like it was injected molded, it takes a little bit of
  work. Typically, when possible it is advised to stick to the same brand.
  - *Sandable Filler* - For finer imperfection we spray the 3D print with a filler before sanding it
    down finely. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/2OqPcEJ)
  - *Paint* - This can be any color you want the device to have. I selected a darker chalk gray color.
  - *Clear Coat (Matte Finish)* - For the final step we seal the surface and add a surface finish.
    Here I selected a clear matte finish. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/4nTvp4r)
