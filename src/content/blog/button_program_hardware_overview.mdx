## Tools

### Soldering Station

This project will require some soldering of various components such as wires and terminals.
There are many different soldering tools with a variety of quality and use-case.

The soldering station that I am working with and that I recommend for beginners is an
all-in-one soldering station kit shown below and [available on Amazon here](https://a.co/d/g1hfNg9).

Here we have everything from [helping hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh5FcqtlWWA)
to solder to [solder sucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGSeSk8QWsE) for de-soldering and cleanup.

### Wire Tools

Building anything electrical will require work with wires. Specifically, for our low current 
and low voltage applications we will be using small [wire gauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge#Tables_of_AWG_wire_sizes).

Wire strippers are often the same tool as wire cutters. Again, as a casual hobbiest, I would
not necessarily recommend the top shelf tools, here a [regular wire cutter/stripper](https://a.co/d/fjoGu2d)
is just fine.

### Multimeter

Often times we will need to test if two things are soldered correctly, connected right, or
give us some voltage at some point and time. In these types of situations (and more),
a [multimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter) comes in very handy. 

A multimeter measures multiple electrical properties: voltage, resistance, and current.
It is one of the most basic and most useful electrical tools you can get familiar with.
Here is a [quick overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF3OyQ3HwfU) on how
to use a multimeter.

Luckily, for the vast majority of hobbiest use-cases, a regular grade multimeter is
just fine, not very expensive, and highly available.

I recommend selecting a multimeter with a good set of probe
features and clamps, a good display, and a kick stand. Maybe something like
[this one](https://a.co/d/6yqiaka).

## Components

### Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W

The [Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/) (RPi Pico 2 W) 
[microcontroller](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/01-background/index.html)
will be our central brain for this project. All logic will live on this microcontroller.

<Figure
  src={rpiPico}
  url="https://a.co/d/8zmC3jx"
/>

This Raspberry Pi is powered by an [arm-based](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Cortex-M33)
[RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/) chip (the [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/specifications/)
is for the RPi Pico 1), while having other on-board [peripherals](https://www.labcenter.com/blog/sim-microcontroller-peripherals/)
such as a wireless module *(the `W` in the name)*, a bluetooth chip, temperature sensor, and more.

<Aside variant="note">
  You are free to use the Raspberry Pi Pico 1 with the RP2040 chip, however the upcoming
  code will have to be modified. Although, coding on the RP2040 chip is "easier", the
  faster and more powerful RP2350 is designed to be more of a industry standard and
  applicable for a more variety of situations.
</Aside>

See the official [Raspberry Pi Pico documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html)
for more information. 

<Aside variant="tip">
  You will have to connect a debug module (see next section) to the RPi. The debug module connects
  to the RPi Pico via 3 debug pins. I would recommend buying the
  [RPi pico with pins already pre-soldered](https://a.co/d/6ulNrik).
</Aside>

The Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W is obviously not the only popular microcontroller of its kind.
You could select a different microcontroller that fits a specific need or skill set.
For example, the [Freenove ESP32-WROOM Board](https://store.freenove.com/products/fnk0090)
is also not a bad choice, however in scope of our project we will stick to the Raspberry Pi.



### Raspberry Pi Pico Debug Probe

When programming and developing on a microcontroller, it is crucial that you know what is
happening on the microcontroller when it is running. That is, when connecting your computer
to the microcontroller you are able to actively view code deployment logs, runtime logging
messages, error messages, and other connection-related messages.

Typically microcontollers provide a debug probe/module that accomplishes just that. Our debug
probe will connect via [UART serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter)
port via the [**3 pins** *(TX, GND, RX)*](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/debug/debug-connector-specification.pdf)
specially designated to it on the Raspberry Pi Pico and located next to the large wireless module.

/>

See the official [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html)
for more information.

<Aside variant="note">
  There is a way to achieve this same function but without a Raspberry Pi debug probe. This
  involves a *second* Raspberry Pi Pico connected to your main one. Here is [more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i2gLeBal9Y)
  about it. However, to gain simplicity by sacrificing cost we are sticking to the official
  debug probe provided for the Raspberry Pi.
</Aside>

### Raspberry Pi Pico Breakout Board for Development

For development and for actual final implementation of our Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, we will use breakout boards.
A [breakout board](https://soldered.com/learn/breakout-boards-what-are-they-and-why-you-should-use-them/) will
take these pins and ‚Äúbreak them out‚Äù onto a separate circuit board. That is, it maps the inputs and outputs of our
Raspberry Pi Pico W onto easily accessible connectors.

During programming and troubleshooting we will utilize a more
complete breakout board. This breakout board includes LEDs for pin inputs and outputs,
more ground connectors, clear labels, and more. We will use this breakout board during
initial programming, testing, and iterations. ([Online Link](https://a.co/d/6anFgCV))

<Figure
  src={breakoutBoardDev}
  url="https://a.co/d/6anFgCV"
/>

<Aside variant="note">
  Here lots of tutorials and manuals may use a electrical [breadboard](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard),
  plugging wires and components like LEDs and buttons into the bread board. This acceptable, however
  to simplify things and quickly get going we will use this development board that has
  on-board LEDs. For buttons, for now, we will simulate a button press by simply touch
  two wires together.
</Aside>

### Wire Assortment

Last but not least. Any electrical project of this type will need wire. In our case, this
assortment provides us with a small gauge wire in different colors. [Online Link](https://a.co/d/jcNjgDM)
It will be slighly more than we will be using for our programming setup, however this wire
will be used in later fabrication steps as well.


<span class="text-accentColor font-bold">Alright! ... Now that we have that out of the way, let's move forward!</span>
