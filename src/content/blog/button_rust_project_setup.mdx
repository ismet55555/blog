## Introduction

<Tag color="green" txt="ðŸ’» HACKER" /> Here we will be creating a new and general Rust project using the `cargo`
command tool. After that, we will ensure that our project is backed up
and version controlled within a new and remote GitHub repository.

## Terminal and IDE

Let's make two assumptions going forward. You know and are able to use a:

1. [Terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) - A program that provides
   a text-based interface for interacting with a computer's operating system, similar to a
   command prompt or terminal window.

    - iTerm for MacOS
    - PowerShell for Windows
    - Terminal for Linux

2. [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) - 
   a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for
   software development, including a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger,
   all in one graphical user interface.

    - Visual Studio Code
    - JetBrains RustRover
    - NeoVim

If you do not, please take a detour and check out how to access, set up,
or use the terminal or an IDE on your computer.

## Base Project Creation

Let's open a local terminal on your computer and change directory into where you want this project to
be on your computer. This will probably be somewhere in your
[home directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory).

<Aside variant="tip">
  Let's stay organized and let's create a `projects` directory in your home directory.
</Aside>

```sh
# Create a projects directory
# Note that the OS will know that $HOME is the home directory location
mkdir -p $HOME/projects/

# Change current directory to the project directory
cd $HOME/projects/
```

Next, *the magic happens*. We will generate a new, simple, general, and ready Rust project
using `cargo`.

```sh
# Create a general Rust project
cargo new big-button

# Change current directory into created project directory
cd big-button
```

Cool! This is the file and directory outline of what we just did.

```sh frame="none"
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml    # Rust dependency manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ .git          # git directory
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore    # Items ignored by git
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ main.rs   # Simple hello world program
```

Note that the templated project we just created includes version control using
[`git`](https://git-scm.com/), while automatically adding a [`.gitignore`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore)
file, telling `git` which files and directories to not version control.

<Aside variant="note">
  This little `cargo` command can be used for any other Rust project you want to
  start from scratch.
</Aside>


## Push the New Project to GitHub

Having your project stored locally is perfectly fine, however in most cases you
want to have your project safely stored somewhere externally on the internet. While there
are many different public and self-hosted services available to do this,
we will choose to store and version-control our project in [GitHub](https://github.com/).

<Figure

  caption="GitHub.com Source Control Mascot: Octocat"
  url="https://github.com/"
/>

To create a new blank project repository in GitHub, do the following:

1. Ensure you are [logged into GitHub.com](https://github.com/login)
2. Create a new repository by visiting [this link](https://github.com/new)
3. Add the new repository details:
    - *Repository Name:* big-button
    - *Description:* This embedded project from this one random online tutorial
    - ... Everything else leave as is.
4. Select *"Create repository"*

Now we have a brand-spanking-new GitHub repository for our project! Next we will
have to connect our local Rust project to this remote repository.

<Aside variant="tip">
  If you are not familiar or comfortable with `git` and version control, please
  take some time and learn it. Here are two good resources for a start: 
    
  - [How Git Works: Explained in 4 Minutes](https://youtu.be/e9lnsKot_SQ?si=mXqyK2ph1aDsT2F3) YouTube Video
  - [Getting Git right](https://www.atlassian.com/git) by Atlassian
</Aside>

The following commands are executed locally within your project's directory. This is the
directory your files like `Cargo.toml` are.

```sh
# Add the remote GitHub repository address as a connection
# Remember to change the "GITHUB_USERNAME" part
git remote add origin git@github.com:GITHUB_USERNAME/big-button.git

# Rename the current branch to "main" (some people prefer this)
git branch -M main

# Git stage (aka. add) all new changes, files, and directories
git add .

# Git commit the staged (aka. added) changes, files, and directories to the current git branch (main)
git commit -m "my initial commit"

# Send this current/local branch to the remote GitHub.com repository
git push -u origin main
```

After this, if you go to your new remote repository on GitHub.com, you should see your
rust project files there!

Awesome! After this we are free to push and save any changes to this remotely hosted
GitHub repository.

## A Quick Test Ride

Let's run the following terminal command within our local project's root directory.

```sh
# Compile and then run our Rust program, optimizing for release
cargo run --release
```

And hopefully after compiling the project and running it,
our output looks like the following.

```txt frame="none"
   Compiling big-button v0.1.0 (/home/you/projects/big-button)
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.09s
     Running `target/release/big-button`
Hello, world!
```

Note, right now our Rust project has nothing to do with our embedded
device. This is a very general "hello world" starter setup.

<span class="text-accentColor font-bold">
  OK! Easy enough. Let's move on and configure this project for our embedded project.
