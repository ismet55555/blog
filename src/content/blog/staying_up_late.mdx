## Title

TODO

- A few months ago a friend asked for some career/life advice. I quickly
  responded with "just stay up late and git something complete done".
  In hindsight, I'm not really sure why I suggested that. It must have
  sounded tone death or kind of some LinkedInLunatic husle culture
  slogan.
- As I always do with these things, after my conversation, I brew on it for a
  while. It was definetly way too late to clarify to my frined what I really meant
  or felt, but it isn't too late to think through why I thought that
  was a good suggestion at the time.

- This post is not about hussle culture!
  - I'm a big proponent about ebbs and flows, pendulum, seasonality, going though motions
- Friend asked me once for advice on a stalled project, seeming to spin his wheels
  - Advice, don't sleep
  - not hussle culture
- You gotta redline it somewhere sometime to get something someone doesn't have
- Getting up super early
- Staying up super late
- Both kind of similar ideas
- Can't get away from consistncy over a long perdiod of time.
- But getting something meaningful done that you can feel/see, you have to
  red-line and go beyond comfort sometime.
- That feeling the next day, gloating over it, seeing some complete thing!
- When did it work for me
  - Doctorate reserach
  - Any meaningful project
- Need
  - direction, excitement, inertia
  - notice when you have momentum
- Willingness to take a sacrifice
  - hit for the day
  - power through the day
  - It is worth it
- These phases accumulate over time
  - refernce autdio book slow work
  - you only need a few of these obsessive sessions to see meaningful results
    - even one will do
- Going from nothing to something is the most difficult
  - this coudl give you that
- This advice goes agains any sleep doctor
  - Add medical warning
  - What other physically risky activiteis result in something meaningful?
  - Are you willing to make that trade/investment?
- Different personaly and experience types
  - Some definetly will not understand and that is ok, this is not for you
- You can't create something without sacrifices
- Yes I wrote this post a little past my bed time :)
