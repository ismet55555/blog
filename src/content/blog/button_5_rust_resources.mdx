## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Here we are going to take a quick but valuable detour on our journey for
the big button project. Don't worry we will be back on our path in the next post.

Our aim here is to give you a wide range of information about Rust resources that
may be relevant to our project. This will be a firehose of information, but
don't worry, most is given for awareness and reference.

It is no secret that lots of the ideas, methods, and materials in the following
resources were used for this project, hence be at least familiar with what they are.

## How to Use This Information

It's not expected that you to read all of these or go over each
tutorial, however do the following.

- Be aware of the contents of these resources. Click on each link, get the general gist,
  think about how it applies to something practical.
- Digest the material that you think relates to our project or fills in missing
  knowledge in Rust programming.
- Add these resources to your bookmarks, or come back to this post for later
  reference.

<Aside variant="tip">
  Don't get sucked into the Rust information black hole or tutorial hell. Keep
  moving and apply!
