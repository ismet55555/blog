## Canned Adolescence Struggle Story

As I was filling out my online ACT exam registration needed for my undergraduate
college application, I realized I will have one shot at this. I had just found out
that this was the test that will determine if I can go to the local college this year, and 
it was the end of my senior year at high school. This was unacceptably late.

Yes, this sounds like some cliche setup to a prestigious scholarship application, or something
that requires a canned adolescence struggle that was overcome by sheer character! But hear me out ...

Hearing "ACT" in the hallways throughout high school years and around flew over my head.
I know the college credit classes kids talked about it. I figured it was some kind of
extra credit thing. Rich kid stuff.

As immigrants who were learning to even communicate in English, asking parents was not an option. 
Googling was not an option, given you have to know and value the concept to ask the question.

Sitting there with the registration screen open (and years later), I tried to trace back how I even got here. 
How did I go from complete ignorance to this panicked late-night registration? Someone must have 
broken throughâ€”said something different, explained it in a way that finally landed. Or maybe 
I stumbled into the knowledge sideways, through some random conversation that suddenly made 
all those hallway mentions click into place.

In later years, this kind of story would repeat itself in all aspects of my life: graduate
school, professional career, or parenthood.

This gap between not knowing and knowing fascinates me. There has to be levels to this. The way
that knowledge moves from completely foreign to desperately necessary.
This experience revealed something fundamental about how knowledge moves
from invisible to essential

## Introduction

To really know about thing is kind is interesting. There is always a blurry gray area between
complete ignorance of something to the complete knoweldge of it. How does someone get
introduced to a piece of knowledge.

Let me ask you - What is it like to vacation in Japan? Or how exactly do
you become a brain surgeon. To what actual and practical detail can
you tell me? If you have never done the thing, have never been the thing, or not have someone close
repeatatly tell you about the thing, how would you really know about it?
And how would you know it within the concept of your own world view and abilities?

<Aside variant="note">
  Here, when I write "a thing", this could mean a physical thing, a concept,
  an idea, a believe, a place, a technique, and so on. I am not talking
  about your "knowledge" of inate abilities like walking, talking, or breathing,
  Maybe, as an exercise, think about something that you yourself have learned
  and how exactly you become familiar with it.
</Aside>


## Knowing Spectrum

Let's outline the extremes here: 

On one side, you absolutely do not even know the thing/concept/place even exists.
It's invisible and unimaginable on any possible level
(example: That key top school entrance exam at a critical time).

On the other extreme, you aboslutely know everything there is to know about
the thing/concept/place.
(ie. How to file that claim at your company where you worked the past 20 years).

<Figure

/>

In reality, this spectrum is more open ended on the latter/right side, 
a one-sided spectrum.
That is, you defiantly can completly not know something and never knew
it existed (ie. What is a stock option?).
However, the level of detail and insight you can get from something
already familiar is infinite (ie. Reading a book a third time around).

<Figure
  src={tba}
  caption="A open-ended spectrum. Maybe even a object being examined on each end"

  isTech={false}
/>

As a analogy, you might think about examining a physical object. At one
extreme you can completely look away from the object, not seeing it, while
on the other end you can examine the object ever closer by getting closer,
looking at it at different angles, or with the help of a magnifying glass.

Here I am focused on describing some practical and discrete levels of 
this one-sided knowledge spectrum that I have observed throughout my life.

## Levels of Knowing

When thinking about where your aquired knowledge fundementally comes from,
there seem to be very distinct levels of discovering and knowing something.

Let's review these proposed levels of knowing:

0. **You do not know the thing or anything about it.
   You can not even have any comfort or emotional response toward it.**

   *Possible example: Knowing the avalanche method to pay of dept*

1. **You know about it or have heard about it. You have the info. You can google it.
   You do not know anyone personally that actually does the thing or is the thing.**

   *Possible exapmle: Seeing a YouTuber that is bow hunting elk in Colorado*

2. **You know someone that is not close to you 
   that does the thing, or is the thing. You personally know that they
   exist, but you do not really know how they think, make descisions, or their
   abilities.**

   *Possible example: Knowing about a friend's father who flips houses and sells them*

3. **The community you are part of naturally does the thing or is the thing.
   The community provides you with lots of direct or indirect examples.
   You are encouraged and supported to do the thing or be it.**

   *Possible example: Being a traditional and Bosnian woman preparing a
    baklava desert for the end of ramadan.*

4. **You have someone very close to you that does the thing or is the thing.
   You know how this person thinks, makes descision, or their abilities.
   You can closely imagine what it is like to be like them on a day to day basis.**

   *Possible example: Your present father is a chemical engnieer*

5. **You yourself have done the thing or are the thing. You have first-hand
   and deep experience.**

   *Possible example: You are a private high school teacher*



## Effort To Know

Given the proposed levels of knowing, a few questions arise.
For some piece of knowledge ...

- What effort does it really take to move up in levels?
   - How can someone in higher levels pull someone up?
   - Is there anything that would block someone from moving up in levels?
- Can one ever fall back in levels? (environment shifts, tide moves)

- Can two individuals 
- Dunning-krugger
- Social proximity

The effort to know something really is non-linear in effort.
This means it takes a great deal to go from knowing nothing about a thing, to knowing at least that thing
really exists and how to precieve it. 

But once you know something really well, there are is likely
a point of dimi

The effort ot move between levels vary, are likely non-linear, and depend on factors
beyond the scope of this essey.


Some people specialize in moving between some levels, or skipping levels,
others are terrible at certain levels, while even others are forever stuck
at certain levels.

Note on suffering:

  - Some things like suffering and pain can't be communicated, but the
    reaction to them can.
  - "If that guy can suffer through it, why can't I?"
  - "If SHE can't figure this out, how am I supposed to?"
  - "If my parents are uncomfortable with it, it must be uncomfortable."

Moving :

0-1 (and all pretty much)
   - luck
   - External force (ie. algorighm)
   - chaos / random
   - accidents
   - crisis

1-2
   - Expand social circle
   - Moving locations
   - Networking evvents

2-3
   - Be born into a communit
   - Join a community
   - marriage / partnership
   - Institutional (ie. military)
   - joining religion

3-4
   - Immediate family
   - Romantic relationship
   - Get closer to others
   - Work closely with others on a common thing
   - Mentorship

4-5
   - Just do it!
   - Family business
   - Personal commitment
   - Fake it till you make it
  


## Comfort of Knowing

TODO

- Less effort -> less comfort



> Now think about this quote: "Know thyself"

## Questions

- Now where does social media fit into all this?
- How does truth fit into all this?
   - The higher you go to better approximation of truth you have
   - The lower you go the less resolution you have, things get blurry then non-esistant
- Where does AI and LLMs fit into all this?
   - Less effort -> less comfort
