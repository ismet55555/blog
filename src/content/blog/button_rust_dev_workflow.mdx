## Table of Contents

## Introduction

In the previous steps we simply edited files with pre-defefined code, before
running some commands in the terminal. This bare workflow may work, however there
are some tools and methods that we can use to help us develop in Rust.

Here we attempt to outline these tools and methods.
The goal here is to show how to add, test, and iterate Rust code for this project.

<Aside variant="tip">
  Remember, a software development workflow can be subjective and ever-evolving, where
  each developer may have his/her preferences, settings, and so on. Being relatively new to Rust 
  embedded development, my advice is to first follow what is outlined here, then try
  to customize and set your workflow however fits you.

## Prerequisites Revisited

As outlined in previous steps, we are making the assumption that you are know
how to use:

1. [Terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)

    - iTerm for MacOS
    - PowerShell for Windows
    - Terminal for Linux

2. [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)

    - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    - JetBrains RustRover
    - NeoVim

Here we will try to touch on each of the above items, however the assumption is that
you are using some type of a terminal emulator and VS Code.

## Tools

Add the following tools to your local toolbelt on your computer. For each tool,
we will briefly mention the tool, outline some notes, and define its importance
and usage.

### `rust-analyzer`

This tool is the official [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
server for Rust that provides [code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_completion) and
code navigation capabilities. Aside from the fundamental Rust tools like `cargo`, `rust-analyzer`
is essential for effective development.

`rust-analyzer` typicall runs in the background and parallel with your IDE, constantly watching
your keystrokes and code changes. When appropriate, it provides auto-completion
hints and options, while also enabling you and your IDE to effectively navigate your
code.

Official documentation for `rust-analyzer` can be found [here](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/book/index.html).

To install `rust-analyzer`, follow these links:

- [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
- [Other IDEs](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/book/other_editors.html)

After installation, `rust-analyzer` is enabled and started by default when working on Rust code.


### `bacon` ü•ì

This tool is a background code checker/linter for Rust that provides real-time error detection and
warnings with minimal user interaction. `bacon` runs continuously
in **a separate terminal**, providing immediate feedback as you code. 

It's highly [customizable](https://dystroy.org/bacon/config/#configuration-files) and integrates
seamlessly with your development workflow. Official documentation for `bacon` can be found [here](https://dystroy.org/bacon/).

To install `bacon`, execute the following:

```sh
cargo install --locked bacon
```

After installation, you can run the following command within the project
root directory (Stop it with pressing `q`):

```sh
bacon --all-features --job clippy
```

<Aside variant="tip">
  [`probe-rs` offers a Visual Studio Code extension](https://probe.rs/docs/tools/debugger/)
  that can use the `probe-rs` CLI tool with VS Code to offer more advanced debugging and monitoring capabilities.
  In this tutorial we will not be focused on using this extension, however I encourage
  you to familiarise yourself with it and see if that is something you are interested in.
</Aside>


### Logging Messages

While logging statments may not be the most powerful
or most *sexy* debugging tool, they are effective, simple to
understand and use, and tried and true!

The concept is simple. Any time you need to see some information at a specific
point in your code, you add a logging statment which will show that
infromation in the terminal output during the program's run.

Specifically speaking, we will use the following syntax to output logging.

```rust title="example.rs"
// Import the following on top of the file
use defmt::*;          // Import all items from defmt 
use defmt_rtt as _;    // Import defmt_rtt - Real-Time Transfer (RTT) as transport for defmt log
use panic_probe as _;  // Ensure that panic messages are send through the debug probe

let my_variable = 3;

// Use the various logging functions
debug!("A debug level logging message");
info!("This is a simple info level log message");
error!("This message has a variable: {}", my_variable);
```

For our configured project, the output for this specific example
Rust code would look like this:

```log frame="none"
[DEBUG ] example.rs:9    : A debug level logging message
[INFO  ] example.rs:10   : This is a simple info level log message
[ERROR ] example.rs:11   : This message has a variable: 3
```


## The Workflow ‚ôªÔ∏è

### Setup

1. Open the project's root directory in the IDE.

2. Open up the first terminal for code warnings/error monitoring.

3. Run the following command in this first terminal:

    ```sh
    bacon --all-features --job clippy
    ```

4. Open up a second terminal for flashing and running our code.


### Add Changes Continuously

1. Using your IDE, make some changes to the code or project configurations.

2. Monitor if those changes raised any warnings or errors in the `bacon` terminal.

3. In second terminal used for flashing and running code, run the following:

    ```sh
    cargo run --release
    ```

4. Monitor logs, the controller, and all the things ...

5. Stop this run with pressing `Ctrl-c`

6. Repeat steps until you are done with your task


### Commit Changes (Saving Your Work)

1. Use `git` to add/stage your changes..

    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

2. Commit changes with a message. Feel free to use
   [conventional git commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

    ```sh
    git commit -m "did some fun work"
    ```

3. Push the changes to GitHub.

    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```

  That'll be our workflow. Now let's add more CODE!
