## How to Use This Tutorial Series?

I completly understand that some of you do not have access to
lots of the maker/hardware tools outlined in some of the following
tutorial steps.

Some may only be interested in either the physical maker methods, while
others may only be interested in the microcontroller/software part.

That is perfectly ok!

The following steps and lessons will be laid out
such that you will be able to complete only the software part with
a microcontroller, the hardware/manufacturing part, or both.

Each tutorial section will be labeled as one or both tag labels:

| Tag | Description | Components |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| <Tag color="green" txt="💻 HACKER" /> | Microcontroller setup and programming | Microcontroller, input/output components, programming tools and code |
| <Tag color="blue" txt="⚒️  MAKER" /> | Physical manufacturing | Making, wiring, mounting. complete physical setup. For [maker space/culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) enthusiasts |

So for example, if you only intend to set up and program your
microcontroller with some basic components, only read sections tagged as <Tag color="green" txt="💻 HACKER" />,
and skip anything labeled <Tag color="blue" txt="⚒️  MAKER" />.

Over the course of these tutorials we will clearly label what is
needed for each label/path.

<Aside variant="note">
  Understand what you will get out of this project for each label/path.
  <br/>
  You can comfortably only follow the <Tag color="green" txt="💻 HACKER" /> path, however without
  the <Tag color="blue" txt="⚒️  MAKER" /> steps, you cannot make a whole and complete product,
  leaving you with raw elecronics.
  <br/>
  On the other hand, if you are only wanting to replicate the physical manufacturing
  process of this project and follow <Tag color="blue" txt="⚒️  MAKER" /> steps, you will
  end up learning some cool maker things, but without the complete product.

## Is This For You?

Ok. You might be wondering if this whole thing is for you. 
Well, in this seciton I will try my best to roughly and objectively
map out the skillset, experience, and knowledge range for 
this project.

Remember, this is not an exact science, just an estimate.
So bear with me here and keep an open and optimistic mind.

### Software Development <Tag color="green" txt="💻 HACKER" />

For all the items below, please ensure you check all of the following
experience for the *software development and embedded programming* parts
of this tutorial.

  - [ ] Used an actual computer *(> 5 years)*
  - [ ] Computer terminal or command line
  - [ ] Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (ie. Code Editor)
  - [ ] Some general text-based programming *(> 2 years)*
  - [ ] Programming with the Rust programming language *(> 6 months)*
  - [ ] Any type of embedded programming *(> 3 months)*

TODO:
- Linear diagrams of skills chart
- Quiz with point systems - need formula
  - Textbox - nope!
  - Sliders - Number of years
  - Checkboxes - "At least X years" - Easiest! - THIS!
    - `<CheckItem txt="Something" />`
  - Radio button - "never used" "somewhat familiar" "very familiar"

experience for the maker and hardware parts of this tutorial.

- [ ] Using general hardware tools (ie. screwdriver, hammer)
- [ ] Soldering with Soldering Iron
- [ ] Stripping a wire with a wire stripper
- [ ] Spray painting something

TODO

- What is the skillset and knowledge range (range image)
  - Is this for me?
  - From never coded to 5 years of Rust Programming
  - From never build anything to maker god
  - Note that interest and passion can trump experience here?

- Specific Skillset
  - Terminal - Know what it is. Have used it.
  - IDE - Know what it is. Have used it.
  - Programming - Know what it is. Have done it.

Bar chart with all of these??
Radial chart?

A Quiz for each section!
  - Spits out likelihood this tutorial is for you
  - Each option brings about some number of points

<Aside variant="tip">
  Do not underestimate your abilities! Especially when you are very interested
  in a project or topic. Lots of times interest and passion can trump
  large skill discreptencies. Give it try. Let's see what happens. :muscle:
