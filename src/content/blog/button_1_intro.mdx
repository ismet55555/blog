## The Embedded Fantasy

**Imagine the following scenario:** You get a call from a good and respected
friend. After some informal conversation he/she switches their tone and prepares to
carefully ask you for an opinion on an idea he/she has. At this point you already
know what is going to happen next.

/>

As a IT professional, you have experienced
this many times. A friend or relative corners you at some event and
*"confidentially"* shares his/her genius industry disruptive idea with a glimmer in their eyes.
So you go into autopilot-politely-interested mode, carefully scanning the conversation
for an exit. But something is different. The more you listen, the more your
friend's story and idea catches your attention.

You become more engaged and inspired.
You can tell he/she has done his/her homework. There are some basic questions that
need to be answered, but in all, this is not just something he/she woke up with
today. To you this seems to be the real deal.

To be more specific, your friend's idea is a prototype of a physical device,
maybe even a Internet of Things (IoT) device or some wearable. You are galvanized, energized,
and want to help, however, it is obvious that you don't have any embedded
systems knowledge and would not know where to start .... that is, until you
find this random online blog series!

Alright, maybe this intro story to [embedded system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system)
is a little too dramatic and too specific, but I do hope I got your attention to read further!

## Project Backstory

Let me explain how this entire blog/tutorial series came about.
Where I live, trash pick up is Tuesdays and Fridays. Or is it Mondays and
Thursdays? Well, maybe one of those days is Wednesday...?

<Figure
  src={trashPickup} 
  url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fysFwSfdQzc"
/>

I still question myself and still can
miss trash day.

Now, I could do two very easy things to solve this issue.

1. Stop being an idiot, just memorize the days, and move on.
2. Set a recurring alarm on my phone for the right days.

Because I am always looking
for a insightful and rewarding engineering side project to be inspired by.
I opted to come up with a much more complicated approach.

I wanted a project to learn and
apply an embedded systems project. Furthermore, I wanted to be more
comfortable with Rust ("blazingly fast") programming as well.

My goal was to create a button that when pressed, sends a
text message to my phone and monitors text message responses.
This allows me to snooze or silence the reminder to take out the trash.

I know, not very big or thought out, but I guess reason enough to
get going and create some thing!

So in short, and very basically,
we are building and programming a <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">BIG glorified push BUTTON</span>.


## Project Goal

Now, obviously you do not need to use this device for trash day reminders
or anything close to that. However, going through this blog series
**should enable you to reuse methods, code, or improvise to develop your own ideas.**

It is my hope that after working through this
project you yourself will be able to solve some problem that requires
embedded systems and Rust programming.

<Aside variant="note">
  *Embedded* can mean many things. Simply put, think of it as programming
  a stand-alone chip/microcontroller that does not already have a
  running operating system (ie. Linux).
</Aside>

The project that we will be developing will be a large red button assembly. This
button assembly will have a variety of features:

- Super large red glowing button
- Fully battery operated (rechargeable, battery lasting for at least a week)
- Multiple fancy LEDs with a variety of light patterns
- Sound buzzer for audio signal feedback
- System On/Off toggle switch
- Wireless internet interconnectivity via REST API

At the time of writing this project introduction, I am not fully able to summarize
the specifics of the project, I am still working through details. 


## How to Use This Tutorial Series?

I completly understand that some of you do not have access to
lots of the maker/hardware tools outlined in some of the following
tutorial steps.

Some may only be interested in either the physical maker methods, while
others may only be interested in the microcontroller/software part.

That is perfectly ok!

The following steps and lessons will be laid out
such that you will be able to complete only the software part with
a microcontroller, the hardware/manufacturing part, or both.

Each tutorial section will be labeled as one or both tag labels:

| Tag | Description | Components |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| <Tag color="green" txt="💻 HACKER" /> | Microcontroller setup and programming | microcontroller, Input/output components, programming tools and code |
| <Tag color="blue" txt="⚒️  MAKER" /> | Physical manufacturing | Making, wiring, mounting. complete physical setup. For [maker space/culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) enthusiasts |

So for example, if you only intend to set up and program your
microcontroller, only read sections tagged as <Tag color="green" txt="💻 HACKER" />,
and skip anything labeled <Tag color="blue" txt="⚒️  MAKER" />.

Over the course of these tutorials we will clearly label what is
needed for each label/path.


## Is This For You?

Ok. You might be wondering if this whole thing is for you. 
Well, in this seciton I will try my best to roughly and objectively
map out the skillset, experience, and knowledge range for 
this project.

Remember, this is not an exact science, just an estimate.
So bear with me here.

- What is the skillset and knowledge range (range image)
  - Is this for me?
  - From never coded to 5 years of Rust Programming
  - From never build anything to maker god
  - Note that interest and passion can trump experience here?

- Specific Skillset
  - Terminal - Know what it is. Have used it.
  - IDE - Know what it is. Have used it.
  - Programming - Know what it is. Have done it.

Bar chart with all of these??
Radial chart?

A quiz of some sort????
  - Spits out likelihood this tutorial is for you
  - Each option brings about some number of points

Divide into software and hardware

------------------------------

<Aside variant="tip">
  Do not underestimate your abilities! Especially when you are very interested
  in a project or topic. Lots of times interest and passion can trump
  large skill discreptencies. Give it try. Let's see what happens. :muscle:

## Semi-Prerequisite Resources

Over the course of this project outline. I will try my very best to describe
and point out all the tools and little weird gotchas I had to struggle with when
developing this project.

Before jumping into this project it would not be the worst idea to overview
the following items. 

- [Fusion 360 3D CAD Software](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription)
- [Ender 3 3D Printer](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer)
- [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/)
- [Rust Programming](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Basic Electrical Circuits](https://www.12voltplanet.co.uk/electrical-circuit-basics.html)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

With each blog post, there will be a **"Resources"** section for further
reading, learning, and review.
