## Introduction

<span class="text-accentColor font-bold">Here we are finally doing some computer software stuff!</span>

<Tag color="green" txt="ðŸ’» HACKER" /> We are going to install all software needed to start interacting with our Raspberry Pi Pico W
microcontroller. We will setup everything for a simple connection [smoke test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)),
verifying things are ready to go for further programming and subsequent steps.

That is, we are explaining and setting up:

- Rust and Rust programming tools
- Debugging and Target Interaction Toolkit

## Rust

This is the part where we get all tools needed to start developing in
the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### About Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, concurrency, and memory efficiency.
It achieves these goals through a unique ownership system, a rich type system, and fearless
concurrency primitives. Basically, it is very good for
[low level programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language).

In terms of programming embedded devices, Rust is great because of the following.

- **Rust provides low-level control:** Efficiently manage memory and hardware without an OS or runtime.
- **Memory safety:** Eliminate entire classes of bugs like null pointer dereferences and data races.
- **Zero-cost abstraction:** Write clean high-level interfaces that compile to optimized machine code.
- **Fast growing ecosystem:** Take advantage of a rapidly expanding set of libraries, tools, and frameworks for embedded Rust.
- **Rust is fast!**

More information on Rust and embedded programming [found here](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded).

### Installing Rust

Once Rust is installed, we will have a few Rust [command line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tools
available. Before installing anything, let's review what each installed Rust tool is used for.

- `rustup`: Manages Rust versions and associated tools. It is used to install, update, and switch between Rust toolchains.
Here is way more information about this tool within [the `rustup` book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/index.html).
Note that a **Rust toolchain** is a single installation of the Rust compiler and associated tools.
You can have multiple toolchains depending on the environment or project.

- `cargo`: Handles dependencies, runs tests, generates documentation, and more.
This is the de facto way to manage Rust projects. This is the most used Rust CLI tool.
There is lots more information on this tool found in [the `cargo` book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html)

- `rustc`: The Rust [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) that transforms your written
code into an [executable/binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable). This command
is typically invoked via `cargo` rather than directly. You will often not use this exclusively by itself.

To check if rust is already installed. Open up your computer [terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac)
and enter the following command. If you do not get a version number, you do **not** have
Rust installed and will have to install it.

```sh
rustc --version
```

The official Rust installation instructions are very good. The installation instructions can be
[found there](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

*If you do have Rust installed*, feel free to go ahead and update all your local Rust toolchains

```sh
rustup update
```

<Aside variant="note">
  For MacOS and Linux, this should be one single and simple command. However, if you are on
  a Windows computer, please visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and download and
  run the `rustup-init.exe`.

## Debugging and Target Interaction Toolkit

### About

When writing code for embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi Pico, you will need to
load code/program/instructions onto the target processor, control its execution,
examine and modify memory contents, and receive debugging information.

A Debugging and Target Interaction Toolkit are programs that provide a set of standardized interfaces and
protocols to facilitate this low-level interaction between the development host computer
and the target embedded system.

This includes:

- Flashing microcontroller firmware
- Reading and writing memory, running, halting, setting and reading breakpoints
- Getting logs from the microcontroller

### `probe-rs`

`probe-rs` is a embedded debugging and target interaction toolkit. It enables its user to
program and debug microcontrollers via a debug probe device. 

Essentially, the interaction between your program/code and the microcontroller flows
through the following order:

1. Your super cool program/code
2. `probe-rs` software
3. USB protocol for hardware (ie. [CMSIS-DAP](https://os.mbed.com/handbook/CMSIS-DAP), [ST-Link](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/ST-LINK), [J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/), [FTDI](https://ftdichip.com/document/technical-notes/))
4. Debug probe hardware
5. Raspberry Pi Pico W Microcontroller

See more information about the [`probe-rs` tool here](https://probe.rs/docs/overview/about-probe-rs/).

<Aside variant="note">
  Note that `probe-rs` is not the only tool for debugging and flashing. Other tools
  include [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/) and [PyOCD](https://pyocd.io/).
</Aside>

### `probe-rs` Install and Setup

The following are install methods and scripts that are found in the official `probe-rs` documentation.
If you are interested in more details or other ways to install this tool
[consult the official website](https://probe.rs/docs/getting-started/installation/).

#### MacOS

Install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager:

```sh
brew tap probe-rs/probe-rs
brew install probe-rs
```

... or using the official installer script:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/releases/latest/download/probe-rs-tools-installer.sh | sh
```

#### Windows

Install using the installer script for Windows pre-installed [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.4) terminal
with the [`irm` (`Invoke-RestMethod`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-restmethod?view=powershell-7.4)
and [`iex` (`Invoke-Expression`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.4)

```powershell title="Powershell"
irm https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/releases/latest/download/probe-rs-tools-installer.ps1 | iex
```

#### Linux

Install using the official installer script:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/releases/latest/download/probe-rs-tools-installer.sh | sh
```

For Linux you will have to set up [Userspace Device Management (udev)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev)
rules for our debug probe separately. **udev rules** are instructions that tell Linux what to do when specific devices
(like USB drives or debug probes) are plugged into your computer.
These rules files control things like who can access the device, what name it gets,
and what automatic actions should happen when the device is connected

Execute the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
# Download the udev rule into /tmp/
curl -o /tmp/69-probe-rs.rules https://probe.rs/files/69-probe-rs.rules

# Move the udev rule file to its system directory
sudo cp /tmp/69-probe-rs.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

# Reload and apply all udev rules to connected devices
sudo udevadm control --reload
sudo udevadm trigger
```

### Verify Debug Probe

Let's verify that our setup worked by connecting our debug probe device
to the computers USB port. For now, don't worry about the Raspberry
Pi Pico W, we are just checking if we can talk to the debug probe.

After connecting the debug probe, run the following command.

```sh
probe-rs list
```

You should see something like the following.

```txt
The following debug probes were found:
[0]: Debug Probe (CMSIS-DAP) -- 2e8a:000c:E6633861A3125F2C (CMSIS-DAP)
```

If you see such an output, *great!* You are done with this section. 
If you do not see that, try some of the following steps.

- Verify all hardware is connected and powered (usb port, debug probe)
- Verify the USB port is properly working
- All of the listed commands executed successfully

{/*
`thumbv6m-none-eabi` is a target triple specifying a particular processor architecture and Application Binary Interface (ABI) for embedded development. Let's break it down:
- `thumbv6m`: This refers to the Arm Thumb instruction set version 6 for Cortex-M series processors. Thumb is a compressed 16-bit instruction set for Arm processors that allows for higher code density and reduced memory usage compared to the full 32-bit Arm instruction set.
- `none`: This means there is no underlying operating system or runtime environment on the target. The software runs directly on the "bare metal" of the processor.
- `eabi`: This stands for Embedded Application Binary Interface, a standard that defines how compiled code interacts with the processor's registers, memory and stack at a low level. 

So `thumbv6m-none-eabi` collectively specifies that the target processor uses the Thumb v6m instruction set, has no operating system, and follows the Embedded ABI calling conventions. This allows a compiler toolchain to generate the correct machine code for that specific type of processor.

The Raspberry Pi Pico's RP2040 processor is a Cortex-M0+ core, which implements the Arm Thumb v6 instruction set. So when developing embedded software for the Pico, you would use a compiler toolchain and libraries that target `thumbv6m-none-eabi` to ensure compatibility.
